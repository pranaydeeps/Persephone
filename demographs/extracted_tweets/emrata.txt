These photos being used w/out my permission is an example of exactly the opposite of what I stand for:

Not about the population. Democracy works when candidates really represent the interests of the people
In fact, politics are for everyone--they impact us all! When people feel disinterested in politics that's a bad sign about the government...
Politics have become something the population feels belongs to some elite group of people who are just interested in "that kind of thing".

Hey thanks @NYMag https://t.co/PpOFPqoOYF
Aren't we passd this bs way of thinking? The whole goal here is to let wmn do what they want for their reasons. To have the power to choose.
Does that make her guilty of something? Is she working against female equality when she decides she wants to wear a sexy skirt?
Why does evry1 worry abt what's done for attntion? Let's say when a wmn dresses sexy she DOES want attention.
My ideas hve developed over time as a response to the criticism and yes, sexism my body &amp; sexuality has generated
To make 1 thing clear, my career is not a plitical action. My social media &amp; modeling are not actions I designed to address feminist issues.
